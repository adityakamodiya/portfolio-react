        <p>I'm a web developer and UI/UX developer. I love to solve design problems, develop new features and design prototypes using different mediums. My work is mainly focused on frontend-development. As for graphic designs, my work mainly involves photo manipulation. Besides, I also like doing photography and videography, where I can express my creative thought process.</p>
